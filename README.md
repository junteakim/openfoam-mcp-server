# OpenFOAM MCP Server

The world's first native OpenFOAM Model Context Protocol server, enabling AI assistants to interact directly with CFD simulations.

## 🚀 Project Vision

This revolutionary project creates a physics-aware AI system that understands computational fluid dynamics, speaks OpenFOAM natively, and provides expert-level guidance for fluid dynamics simulations.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

This project uses GitHub Codespaces with VS Code Desktop for cloud-native development.

### Quick Start
1. **Open in Codespaces**: Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on Development"
2. **Connect VS Code Desktop**: Install GitHub Codespaces extension and connect
3. **Auto-configuration**: Environment sets up automatically with OpenFOAM 12
4. **Start building**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Build MCP Server"

### What You Get
- ✅ **OpenFOAM 12**: Latest stable release from OpenFOAM Foundation
- ✅ **C++20 Environment**: Modern C++ with full OpenFOAM integration
- ✅ **Claude Code Integration**: AI-powered development assistant
- ✅ **VS Code Desktop**: Full IntelliSense and debugging capabilities
- ✅ **Cloud Development**: 4-32 core machines with zero local setup
